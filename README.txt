This is a discovery project about implementing a behaviour tree system and his editor in Unity.

This code is not intended to be efficient in production as it is my first experience with behaviour trees and custom editors as an extention of Unity.

The implementation is partially inspired by the article of Chris Simpson, "Behavior trees for AI: How they work" : https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php
